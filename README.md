This WebGL game was my senior thesis where me and a group of 3 developers and 2 sound engineers designed and developed a game for NASAs Mission To Psyche

This is a Web GL game built in Unity

The full Unity code repo can be found on the official Mission To Psysche github
https://github.com/MissionToPsyche/tungsten_12n_web_game

Included in this project are all the c# scripts written by me to make this game possible
Most important Software design patterns considered were scalability, microservices and cohesion of the scripts
